# Rhyme-Detector
A program that detects assonance in any song with lyrics on genius.com. It's not perfect, but it's pretty cool.


It requires the following packages:
nltk, json, requests, re, BeautifulSoup, and PyQT5

The lyricScrub.py file is mostly just edited code written by Will Soares (willamesoares). The code for his lyric-crawler is here: https://github.com/willamesoares/lyrics-crawler.git

Currently, you have to hit enter after typing in the song and artist name, "Find Lyrics" button does not work. Also, to try a different song, you have to terminate and then re-run the program.


If anyone could figure out how to highlight the vowels in words with multiple vowels please let me know how

# To use it, run the LyricFinderGUI.py file

Here are a couple examples of what the output looks like:

# "Halftime" by Nas (Verse 1)
