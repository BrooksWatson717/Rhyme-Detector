# Rhyme-Detector
A program that detects assonance in any song with lyrics on genius.com. It's not perfect, but it's pretty cool.


It requires the following packages:
nltk, json, requests, re, BeautifulSoup, and PyQT5

The lyricScrub.py file is mostly just edited code written by Will Soares (willamesoares). 

Currently, you have to hit enter after typing in the song and artist name, "Find Lyrics" button does not work. Also, to try a different song, you have to terminate and then re-run the program.

To use it, run the LyricFinderGUI.py file
