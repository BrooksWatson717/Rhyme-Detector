# Rhyme-Detector
A program that detects assonance in any song with lyrics on genius.com. It's not perfect, but it's pretty cool.


It requires the following packages:
nltk, json, requests, re, BeautifulSoup, and PyQT5

The lyricScrub.py file is mostly just edited code written by Will Soares (willamesoares).
